## [Competitor analysis](https://www.qualtrics.com/au/experience-management/brand/research-competitors/)

  
Competitor analysis is the process of evaluating and understanding the strengths and weaknesses of current and potential competitors in a given market. It involves gathering and analyzing information about competitors' strategies, capabilities, market position, and performance to gain insights that can inform strategic decision-making. Competitor analysis is a critical component of strategic planning and helps businesses identify opportunities, threats, and areas for differentiation.

### **1. What is Competitor Analysis?**

- **Imagine a Race:** Think of your business as a participant in a race. Competitor analysis is like studying the other racers to understand their strengths, weaknesses, and strategies.

### **2. Identifying Competitors:**

- **Who Are Your Rivals?** Identify businesses that are similar to yours, selling similar products or services. These are your competitors.

### **3. Strengths and Weaknesses (SWOT):**

- **Superhero Analysis:** Pretend each competitor is a superhero. What are their superpowers (strengths) and weaknesses? This helps us know how strong they are in the race.

### **4. How They Stand Out:**

- **Superhero Costumes:** Each competitor wears a unique costume. This is like their unique selling point – something special that makes customers choose them.

### **5. Products and Services:**

- **Race Cars and Bicycles:** What kind of "race cars" or "bicycles" (products/services) do your competitors have? Are they faster, more comfortable, or cooler?

### **6. Market Share:**

- **Who's Leading the Race?** Check who is ahead in the race – who has more customers or sells more products. This helps us know the leaders.

### **7. What People Say:**

- **Ask the Spectators:** Imagine the audience as your customers. What are they saying about each competitor? This helps us understand what people like or dislike.

### **8. How Much Does it Cost:**

- **Race Ticket Prices:** Compare the "ticket prices" (pricing) of your competitors. Who is offering the best deal for customers?

### **9. Where They Sell:**

- **Different Racetracks:** See where your competitors sell their products – online, in stores, or both. This helps us know where they are focusing.

### **10. Friends and Enemies:**

- **Superhero Alliances:** Sometimes superheroes team up. Your competitors might also have friends or partnerships (alliances) that make them stronger.

### **Why Competitor Analysis Matters:**

- **Race Strategy:** Imagine playing a video game. Knowing your competitors' moves (strategies) helps you plan your own strategy to win the game.

### **Example:**

- **Race Day:** Picture the day of the race. You want to know who the other racers are, what special abilities they have, and where you can run faster or smarter to win.

In simple terms, competitor analysis is like studying other players in a game or racers in a race. It helps businesses understand their competition, make smart decisions, and have a better chance of winning in the market.

## [Competitive-position](https://hbr.org/2007/11/mapping-your-competitive-position)

Eight weeks. That’s all that separated the launch of Apple’s revolutionary iPhone, on June 29, 2007, and Motorola’s next-generation Razr2 (pronounced Razr Squared) cellular telephone, on August 24. Before unveiling the successor to the Razr, which _PC World_ magazine in 2005 ranked 12th on a list of the 50 greatest gadgets of the past 50 years

Most companies have to build fresh competitive advantages and destroy others’ advantages faster than they used to.
According to a 2004 survey by Strativity, a global research and consulting firm. Worse, 50% of salespeople don’t know what attributes justify the prices of the products and services they sell.

**If customers don’t know what they’re paying for, and managers don’t know what they’re charging for, it’s almost impossible for companies to identify their competitive positions**

A price-benefit positioning map provides insights into the relationship between prices and benefits, and tracks how competitive positions change over time.

#### Define the market.
To draw a meaningful map, you must specify the boundaries of the market in which you’re interested.
#### Choose the price and determine the primary benefit.

Once you’ve defined the market, you need to specify the scope of your analysis of prices. You have implicitly decided whether to study retail or wholesale prices when you chose which market to focus on, but you must also consider other pricing parameters. You must choose whether to compare initial prices or prices that include life cycle costs, prices with transaction costs or without them, and the prices of unbundled or bundled offers. These choices depend on the yardstick that customers use in making purchasing decisions in the market under study. Remember to be consistent about the price definition you use while gathering data.

**Regression analysis** examines the relationship between a dependent variable (in this case, price) and several independent variables (product benefits) and creates a mathematical model of that relationship called the regression equation (in this case, the price-benefit equation).

- **Imagine a Lemonade Stand:**
    - You have a lemonade stand, and you want to figure out what makes your lemonade stand out from others.
    - Variables might include the price of your lemonade, how friendly your service is, and how tasty your lemonade is.
    - Regression analysis would help you understand if there's a connection between these variables. For example, you might find that when you lower the price a bit, more people buy your lemonade.
In nutshell, regression analysis helps them understand the relationships between different factors and make informed decisions to stay ahead in the competitive game.

### Position maps
Position maps, also known as perceptual maps or brand maps, are visual tools used in marketing and competitive analysis to illustrate how consumers perceive and position different products or brands in relation to each other. These maps help businesses understand the competitive landscape and make strategic decisions based on consumer perceptions. Let's break it down in simpler terms:

### **Key Points:**

1. **Imagine a Map:**
    
    - Think of a map that shows the positions of different places. In this case, the places are products or brands.
2. **Consumer Perceptions:**
    
    - Position maps focus on how consumers see and think about products or brands. It's like asking people, "Where do you think these brands stand in terms of certain qualities?"
3. **Two Important Factors:**
    
    - Usually, position maps consider two important factors that consumers care about. For example, it could be "Price" and "Quality" for smartphones.
4. **Placing Brands on the Map:**
    
    - Each brand gets a spot on the map based on how consumers perceive them regarding those two factors. If a brand is known for high quality and high price, it might be placed in a different spot than a brand known for low price and lower quality.
5. **Visual Representation:**
    
    - The map is a visual representation with brands plotted as points. The distance between points shows how different brands are perceived in relation to each other.

### **Example: Smartphone Position Map:**

- **Two Factors:**
    
    - Imagine you're making a position map for smartphones, and the two factors are "Price" and "Features."
- **Brands Plotted:**
    
    - You ask people about their perception of different smartphone brands based on price and features.
        
    - - High-End: Brands like Apple and Samsung might be placed high on the map because they are perceived as having high prices and advanced features.
    - - Mid-Range: Brands like OnePlus might be in the middle, offering good features at a moderate price.
    - - Budget: Brands like Xiaomi might be at the lower end, offering budget-friendly options with fewer advanced features.
- **Visualizing Positions:**
    
    - The map shows the positions of these brands, and you can see how they compare in terms of what consumers value – price and features.

### **Why Position Maps Matter:**

- **Strategic Decision-Making:**
    
    - Businesses use position maps to make strategic decisions. For example, if a brand wants to move to a higher-end market, it might adjust its features and prices accordingly.
- **Understanding Competitors:**
    
    - Position maps help businesses understand where they stand compared to competitors. Are they the affordable choice, the high-end option, or somewhere in between?
- **Consumer Insights:**
    
    - Provides insights into what consumers value and how they perceive different brands. This information helps businesses tailor their products and marketing.
- **Adaptation and Differentiation:**
    
    - Helps businesses adapt to changing consumer preferences and differentiate themselves in the market.

Position maps are like snapshots of the market, showing where different brands stand in the eyes of consumers. They guide businesses in navigating the competitive landscape and making decisions that align with consumer perceptions and

## Strategy maps
### 1. **Imagine a Treasure Map:**

- Think of a treasure map that shows the path to a hidden treasure. A strategy map is somewhat like that, but instead of finding treasure, it helps a business or organization find success.

### 2. **Goals and Objectives:**

- On this map, there are big goals and objectives, like becoming the best at something or making a lot of money. These are the destinations the organization wants to reach.

### 3. **Different Areas on the Map:**

- The map has different sections, like neighborhoods in a city. Each section represents an important aspect of the organization's success. For example, there might be a "Customer Neighborhood," a "Financial Neighborhood," and others.

### 4. **Connecting the Dots:**

- Now, imagine lines connecting these neighborhoods. These lines show how one area is connected to another. It's like saying, "If we do well in this neighborhood, it will help us in that neighborhood too."

### 5. **Markers and Landmarks:**

- In each neighborhood, there are markers or landmarks. These represent specific things the organization needs to do to be successful. For instance, in the "Customer Neighborhood," there might be a marker for making customers really happy.

### 6. **Measuring Progress:**

- To make sure they're on the right path, there are signs or measures along the way. These are like road signs that say, "You are getting closer to your goal." They help the organization know if they are doing well or if they need to adjust their route.

### 7. **Action Plans:**

- Imagine little action figures or workers on this map. These are the people in the organization, and they have plans (like missions) to reach each marker or landmark. These plans are the things the organization will actually do to be successful.

### **Example - The Adventure of a Lemonade Stand:**

- Let's say you have a lemonade stand. Your goal is to sell the most lemonade in town.
    
- - **Neighborhoods:** You have different neighborhoods on your map – "Customer Happiness," "Quality Lemonade," "Profit Street."
- - **Connecting Lines:** Lines connect these neighborhoods, showing that if you make great lemonade (Quality Lemonade), customers will be happy (Customer Happiness), and you'll make more money (Profit Street).
- - **Markers:** In the "Quality Lemonade" neighborhood, there's a marker that says, "Use the best lemons." That's something you need to do to make great lemonade.
- - **Measuring Progress:** Signs along the way tell you how many cups of lemonade you've sold. If the number is going up, it means you're getting closer to your goal.
- - **Action Plans:** Your action figure is you, making the best lemonade, being friendly to customers, and always improving.

### **Why Strategy Maps Matter:**

- - **Finding Success:** Just like a treasure map helps you find treasure, a strategy map helps businesses find success by showing them where to go and what to do.
- - **Teamwork:** It helps everyone in the organization work together because they all understand the map and their roles in reaching the goals.
- - **Adapting the Plan:** If they see a road sign saying they need to change direction, they can adapt their plans to stay on the right track.

So, a strategy map is like a visual guide that helps businesses know where they want to go, how different parts are connected, and what they need to do to be successful. It's an adventure map for reaching their goals!

### Customer value proposition 
A Customer Value Proposition (CVP) is a statement that clearly articulates the unique benefits and value that a product or service offers to its customers. It communicates why a customer should choose a particular product or service over alternatives available in the market. The customer value proposition is a fundamental element of a company's marketing and business strategy. Here are key components and considerations related to a customer value proposition:

### **Components of a Customer Value Proposition:**

1. **Value Offered:**
    
    - Clearly states the specific value or benefits the product or service provides to the customer. This could include features, advantages, or outcomes that address the customer's needs or challenges.
2. **Differentiation:**
    
    - Highlights what makes the product or service unique and sets it apart from competitors. This could be a unique feature, superior quality, better performance, or a distinctive aspect of the brand.
3. **Target Customer:**
    
    - Defines the specific target audience or customer segment that the product or service aims to serve. It helps in tailoring the value proposition to the needs and preferences of a particular group of customers.
4. **Problem Solving:**
    
    - Clearly communicates how the product or service solves a particular problem or fulfills a need for the customer. It emphasizes the solution it provides rather than just its features.
5. **Emotional Appeal:**
    
    - Considers the emotional aspects of the customer experience. It may evoke emotions, such as joy, convenience, security, or excitement, to create a deeper connection with customers.
6. **Simplicity and Clarity:**
    
    - The value proposition should be concise, easy to understand, and clearly communicated. It should avoid jargon and complex language.

### **Example of a Customer Value Proposition:**

Let's take an example of a fictitious company that sells fitness trackers:

**Value Offered:**

- "Our fitness tracker helps you stay active and healthy by tracking your steps, calories burned, and sleep patterns."

**Differentiation:**

- "Unlike other trackers, ours is water-resistant, has a long battery life, and provides personalized insights based on your activity."

**Target Customer:**

- "Designed for fitness enthusiasts who want a durable and feature-rich tracker to support their active lifestyle."

**Problem Solving:**

- "Solves the challenge of keeping track of your fitness goals and provides actionable insights to help you achieve them."

**Emotional Appeal:**

- "Experience the joy of reaching your fitness milestones with a tracker that understands and supports your journey."

**Simplicity and Clarity:**

- "Achieve your fitness goals with our water-resistant tracker that lasts for days on a single charge."

### **Importance of Customer Value Proposition:**

1. **Competitive Advantage:**
    
    - A compelling customer value proposition provides a competitive advantage by clearly communicating why a product or service is superior to alternatives.
2. **Customer Decision-Making:**
    
    - Influences customers' decision-making by helping them understand the unique benefits and value they will receive.
3. **Brand Positioning:**
    
    - Contributes to brand positioning by establishing a distinct and memorable identity in the minds of customers.
4. **Customer Loyalty:**
    
    - Builds customer loyalty by consistently delivering on the promised value and maintaining a positive customer experience.
5. **Marketing and Communication:**
    
    - Guides marketing and communication efforts, ensuring a consistent and focused message that resonates with the target audience.

A well-crafted customer value proposition serves as a powerful tool for businesses to attract and retain customers in a competitive market. It answers the fundamental question: "Why should customers choose our product or service?"
### Mobil's Strategy map
[source](https://hbr.org/2000/09/having-trouble-with-your-strategy-then-map-it)
![[Pasted image 20240122134009.png]]

#### Customer perspective
Mobil, in the past, had attempted to sell a full range of products and services to all consumers, while still matching the low prices of nearby discount stations. But this unfocused strategy had failed, leading to poor financial performance in the early ’90s. Through market research, Mobil discovered that price-sensitive consumers represented only about 20% of gasoline purchasers, while consumer segments representing nearly 60% of the market might be willing to pay significant price premiums for gasoline if they could buy at stations that were fast, friendly, and outfitted with excellent convenience stores. With this information, Mobil made the crucial decision to adopt a “differentiated value proposition.” The company would target the premium customer segments by offering them immediate access to gasoline pumps, each equipped with a self-payment mechanism; safe, well-lit stations; clean restrooms; convenience stores stocked with fresh, high-quality merchandise; and friendly employees

Mobil decided that the consumer’s buying experience was so central to its strategy that it invested in a new system for measuring its progress in this area. Each month, the company sent “mystery shoppers” to purchase fuel and a snack at every Mobil station nationwide and then asked the shoppers to evaluate their buying experience based on 23 specific criteria. Thus, Mobil could use a fairly simple set of metrics (share of targeted customer segments and a summary score from the mystery shoppers) for its consumer objectives.
#### Internal process perspective
Mobil’s internal process objectives included building the franchise by developing new products and services, such as sales from convenience stores; and enhancing customer value by training dealers to become better managers and by helping them generate profits from non gasoline products and services. The plan was that if dealers could capture increased revenues and profits from products other than gasoline, they could then rely less on gasoline sales, allowing Mobil to capture a larger profit share of its sales of gasoline to dealers.

For its customer intimacy strategy, Mobil had to excel at understanding its consumer segments. And because Mobil doesn’t sell directly to consumers, the company also had to concentrate on building best-in-class franchise teams.

#### Learning and Growth Perspective.
Mobil identified that its employees needed to gain a broader understanding of the marketing and refining business from end to end. Additionally, the company knew it had to nurture the leadership skills that were necessary for its managers to articulate the company’s vision and develop employees. Mobil identified key technologies that it had to develop, including automated equipment for monitoring the refining processes and extensive databases and tools to analyze consumers’ buying experiences.

 greatest benefit of strategy maps is their ability to communicate strategy to an entire organization
Strategy implies the movement of an organization from its present position to a desirable but uncertain future position.
The key, then, to implementing strategy is to have everyone in the organization clearly understand the underlying hypotheses, to align all organizational units and resources with those hypotheses, to test the hypotheses continually, and to use those results to adapt as required.
