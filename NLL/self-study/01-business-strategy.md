### Key topics
- PESTEL Framework

The general goal of a [sustainable business strategy](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/business-sustainability-strategies) is to positively impact the environment, society, or both, while also benefiting shareholders

The triple bottom line can be broken down into “three P's”: profit, people, and the planet. Firms can use these categories to conceptualize their environmental responsibility and determine any negative social impacts to which they might be contributing.

- Land and expand
- Do next right thing
- when people starts to listen when you say - I think
- ERDA - story telling model
- Articulation frame works
- Leadership is differentiating yourself 
- Understand problem better and build up on that
## Porters Five Forces
The model helps identify and understand the key factors that shape the level of competition and attractiveness of an industry.Here are the five forces explained in simpler terms:
1. **Threat of New Lemonade Stands:**
    
    - How easy is it for someone else to start their own lemonade stand? If it's super easy, there might be a lot of competition. But if it's harder, like needing a special recipe or a big lemon supply, there might be fewer new stands.
2. **Bargaining Power of Lemonade Buyers:**
    
    - How much power do the people who want to buy lemonade have? If they can easily get lemonade from other stands or drink something else, they have more power. But if your lemonade is super special and everyone loves it, you have more power.
3. **Bargaining Power of Lemon Suppliers:**
    
    - Where do you get your lemons? If there's only one lemon supplier, they have a lot of power. But if there are many suppliers or you have your own lemon tree, you have more control.
4. **Threat of Other Drinks:**
	-Threat of Substitute Products or Services
    
    - What if people start to prefer other drinks, like iced tea or smoothies? The more options there are, the more you need to make sure your lemonade is the best choice.
5. **Competition among Lemonade Stands:**
		-Intensity of Competitive Rivalry
    
    - How many other lemonade stands are there in your neighborhood? If there are a lot, you'll need to work extra hard to stand out. But if there are only a few, you might have an easier time.
### How to Think About It:

1. **Know Your Competition:**
    
    - Understand how many lemonade stands are already around and how good their lemonade is.
2. **Make Special Lemonade:**
    
    - Think about what makes your lemonade unique. Maybe you have a secret ingredient or a special way of serving it.
3. **Make Friends with Your Lemon Supplier:**
    
    - If you know where your lemons come from and have a good relationship with your supplier, you can make sure you always have fresh lemons.
4. **Listen to Your Customers:**
    
    - Pay attention to what your customers like or don't like. If they want something different, be ready to change your recipe or add new flavors.
5. **Work Hard to Stand Out:**
    
    - If there are many lemonade stands, think about what you can do differently to attract customers. Maybe you have a cool sign or offer free samples.

In the end, Porter's Five Forces helps you think about the challenges and opportunities in your lemonade stand business, so you can make smart decisions to be successful!

## [Triple Bottom Line](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/what-is-the-triple-bottom-line) - TBL

The three "bottom lines" are often referred to as "people, planet, and profit." This framework aims to measure and evaluate a company's impact and sustainability in a broader sense.By considering the Triple Bottom Line, organizations aim to create value not only for shareholders but also for society and the environment. This holistic approach to business recognizes the interconnectedness of economic, social, and environmental factors in creating a sustainable and responsible business model.
- **Integration of Three Dimensions:**
    
    - The TBL encourages organizations to integrate social and environmental considerations into their decision-making processes alongside financial factors.
- **Long-Term Sustainability:**
    
    - The concept emphasizes the importance of long-term sustainability, recognizing that businesses need to be profitable over time while contributing positively to society and minimizing their environmental impact.
- **Stakeholder Engagement:**
    
    - TBL encourages businesses to engage with a broader range of stakeholders, including employees, customers, communities, and environmental advocates, to understand and address their concerns.
- **Reporting and Accountability:**
    
    - Companies adopting the TBL approach often produce sustainability reports that provide transparency about their performance in the three dimensions. This helps stakeholders assess the organization's overall impact.
- **Global Citizenship:**
    
    - The Triple Bottom Line is aligned with the idea of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and global citizenship, promoting ethical business practices that benefit both the company and the wider world.
## Value chain analysis
Value Chain Analysis is a strategic management tool that helps businesses understand and evaluate the series of activities involved in the production and delivery of a product or service. Developed by Michael Porter, this concept identifies and analyzes each step of the process to determine where value is added and costs are incurred. The goal is to identify opportunities for competitive advantage and optimization within the entire value chain.

These are the core activities directly involved in the creation, production, and delivery of the product or service:
![[Pasted image 20240121214327.png]]
Let's imagine you're running a lemonade stand, and you want to figure out how to make it the best lemonade stand in town. Value Chain Analysis is like breaking down all the steps from getting lemons to selling lemonade to see where you can do things better.

### **Primary Activities:**

1. **Inbound Logistics (Getting Lemons):**
    
    - This is similar to the procurement factor. It involves finding the best supplier for lemons, negotiating prices, and ensuring a fresh and quality supply.
2. **Operations (Making Lemonade):**
    
    - The process of making lemonade is the core operation, similar to the operations factor in the value chain. Here, you focus on the recipe, quality control, and efficiency.
3. **Outbound Logistics (Selling Lemonade):**
    
    - Setting up the stand and selling lemonade is comparable to outbound logistics. This involves the distribution and delivery of the finished product (lemonade) to customers.
4. **Marketing and Sales:**
    
    - Promoting your lemonade stand, attracting customers, and offering promotions fall under the marketing and sales factor.
5. **Service (Customer Service):**
    
    - How you treat customers and the overall customer experience align with the service factor in the value chain. It includes aspects like friendliness, responsiveness, and customer satisfaction.

### **Support Activities:**

1. **Procurement (Buying Supplies):**
    
    - This aligns with the procurement factor in the value chain. It involves sourcing and purchasing supplies like cups, napkins, and signs at the best possible prices.
2. **Technology Development (Planning for the Future):**
    
    - Planning for the future of your lemonade stand, such as adding new flavors, represents the technology development factor. It involves innovation and improvements to stay competitive.
3. **Human Resource Management (Customer Service):**
    
    - Treating customers well and providing excellent service relates to human resource management. It involves managing the human aspect of the business, emphasizing friendliness and positive interactions.
4. **Infrastructure (Setting up the Stand):**
    
    - Setting up the lemonade stand and ensuring an attractive and convenient location is akin to infrastructure. It includes the physical setup and arrangement for optimal visibility.

### **Financial Factor:**

1. **Counting the Money:**
    - Counting the money earned from selling lemonade is part of the financial factor. It involves tracking revenue, expenses, and overall financial performance.

### **Strategic Considerations:**

- **Competitive Advantage:**
    
    - Finding the best lemons, creating a unique recipe, and offering excellent customer service contribute to gaining a competitive advantage in the lemonade market.
- **Cost Analysis:**
    
    - Keeping track of expenses, negotiating with suppliers, and finding cost-effective solutions for supplies are part of cost analysis to maintain profitability.
- **Customer Focus:**
    
    - Both marketing and sales activities and customer service emphasize the importance of understanding and meeting customer needs.
- **Innovation:**
    
    - Planning for the future involves innovation, which is essential for staying ahead of the competition. This aligns with the technology development factor.

By applying Porter's Value Chain Analysis to the lemonade stand example, you can systematically assess and optimize each step of the business process for better overall performance and competitiveness.

## [Innovation as Strategy](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/developing-a-competitive-strategy/competing-through-disruption-2?autoSkip=true&resume=false&u=57692769)

![[Pasted image 20240121215918.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240121220126.png]]
- Big is not always better, hard to introduce change and keep innovating
- we have to compare company with initial stage and check if its nimble.
### Finding your alpha

Absolutely! Let's break down the concept of bucket categorization using simpler language suitable for an 8th-grade understanding:
### **1. Alpha Bucket:**

- **What it is:** This is like the "big ideas" bucket. It's where we put projects that are super important for the long run.
- **Why it's important:** These projects are about making something completely new or better than anything else. It's like creating the coolest lemonade that everyone will want to buy because it's so special.

### **2. Beta Bucket:**

- **What it is:** The "make it better" bucket. After we've figured out something really cool in the Alpha Bucket, we try to do it even better here.
- **Why it's important:** It's like when you make your lemonade stand more efficient and organized. You want to use what you learned in the Alpha Bucket to make things even smoother and sell more lemonade.

### **3. Gamma Bucket:**

- **What it is:** The "be ready for anything" bucket. In here, we're always ready to change and try new things based on what's happening around us.
- **Why it's important:** Imagine if suddenly everyone wants a different flavor of lemonade. In the Gamma Bucket, we're flexible and can quickly add new flavors or change things up to stay popular.

### **Why We Use Buckets:**

- **To be smart planners:** Buckets help us organize our projects based on how important they are and how much risk is involved.
- **To have a balanced plan:** We don't want to just focus on one thing. Buckets help us balance between coming up with new ideas, improving what we have, and being ready for changes.

### **Example - Lemonade Stand:**

- - **Alpha:** Coming up with a completely new lemonade flavor that no one else has.
- - **Beta:** Making your lemonade stand more organized and finding ways to sell more cups.
- - **Gamma:** Being ready to change your lemonade stand quickly if people start wanting a different kind of drink.

### **Why It's Cool:**
- **Always learning:** We're always trying to make things better and learn new stuff.
-  **Being creative:** It's like being a lemonade inventor and making the best lemonade stand in town.
### Apple Inc example
- outsource all gammas
- consider outsourcing all betas 
- Strengthen your alphas
- Develop a strategy to expand the size of your alpha bucket
- Leverage your alpha to diversigy into new market opportunities
Example Apple inc
-  alpha : i phones, software OS,
- beta : application development
- gamma : manufacturing
Apple is good at alpha so they expanded to ipad, laptops, iwatch
Gamma and beta are outsourced

### Competitive Advantage
A function of whether you are better,faster and/or cheaper relative to your competitors
Competitive advantage is always market-specific, and its always relative
Ford,GE and another car company's were doing good unless japan car company like toyota,honda entered american markets

### Business Model
1. Decide who your target customers will be.
2. Define what products and services to offer.
3. Design the value chain to deliver products and services
#### Disruption Strategy (D1)
Dramatically reengineer the value chain with out changing products and services. 
eg : Amazon
####  Disruption Strategy (D2)
Dramatically redefine what products and services you will offer
eg : starbucks: CEO always says, starbucks is not another coffee outlet, its a second home where people can hangout, they offer wider space so people are not in rush
#### Disruption Strategy (D3)
Radically rethink all theree elements of the business model:
- Target customers
- Products and services
- Design value chain
Apple directly sold their computers instead of selling it to outlets or sales people (Value chain)

###  On Stage competitive advantage
The perceptions of target customers about how your goods and services compare with those of competitors
### Back stage competitive advantage
How your resources, capabilities and relationships compare with those of your competitors
Backstage helps on-stage
**kmart vs walmart**
walmart has good supply chain in rural areas where kmart had good market in urban areas, over a period of time walmart won.

Samsung backstage relation with google on android has good effect on on-stage advantage

> No company can operate in vacum

### Understanding industry dynamics
#### Your company's ecosystem
- Suppliers
- Customers
- Complementors
- Competitors
![[Pasted image 20240121232043.png]]
intel and micro soft are examples of complementors

**Importance of coplementers**
1. They are your allies
2. They are economic competitors
3. They could become a direct competitors

Dell introduced a concept of customisation of laptops based on user need, user can select ram he needs, hard drive and etc.. this helped their sales
 Amazon 1 click process - patented - it reduced friction

### Superior value-chain Architecture
How company connects starting point to ending point
Map out the entire value chain of your business
Could you completely redesign the architecture of the value chain

**Relation ship advantage**
Switching from micro soft to other competitors  are hard
But its easy to move from coke to pepsi, but still people stick to one brand due to advertising
![[Pasted image 20240121235128.png]]
Toyota has good relation ship with its suppliers so its able to build better 

## [Innovation-value-chain](https://hbr.org/2007/06/the-innovation-value-chain)
The innovation value chain view presents innovation as a sequential, three-phase process that involves 
- idea generation
- idea development
- diffusion of developed concepts.

### [VALUE-BASED STRATEGY](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/value-based-strategy)
#### THE VALUE STICK

The **value stick** is a visual representation of a value-based pricing strategy’s different components. At the top of the stick is the value that’s been captured by the end consumer, called customer delight. In the middle is the value captured by the firm, called the firm’s margin. At the bottom of the stick is the value captured by the firm’s suppliers, called supplier surplus.

The value stick comprises four components: willingness to pay (WTP), price, cost, and willingness to sell (WTS). Where on the stick each of these points falls determines how a sale’s value is split between a firm, its customers, and suppliers.
![[Pasted image 20240122002241.png]]
[Willingness to pay](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/willingness-to-pay) is the highest price a customer is willing to pay for your product or service.The difference between the customer’s willingness to pay and the final price of the purchase is known as customer delight. This is the level of goodwill, loyalty, and brand enthusiasm the customer feels after making a purchase

**Price** refers to the final price a company charges when it sells a product or service

**Cost** refers to how much money goes into producing a product or service

**Willingness to sell**, also known as willingness to accept, is the lowest price a firm’s suppliers are willing to accept in exchange for the raw materials needed to create products

When the four points above are plotted along the value stick, they create three wedges: customer delight, firm margin, and supplier surplus.
