### Price Skimming?

Price skimming is a product pricing strategy by which a firm charges the highest initial price that customers will pay and then lowers it over time. As the demand of the first customers is satisfied and competition enters the market, the firm lowers the price to attract another, more price-sensitive segment of the population

> Customers are interested in the value they get, not in the features

The vision has to be very easy to communicate.
