		    Lesson 5.3: A SELECTIVE WRITE COMMAND
	** To save part of the file, type   :#,# w FILENAME **

  1. Once again, type  :!dir  or  :!ls  to obtain a listing of your directory
     and choose a suitable filename such as TEST.

  2. Move the cursor to the top of this page and type  Ctrl-g  to find the
     number of that line.  REMEMBER THIS NUMBER!

  3. Now move to the bottom of the page and type  Ctrl-g again.  REMEMBER THIS
     LINE NUMBER ALSO!

  4. To save ONLY a section to a file, type   :#,# w TEST   where #,# are
     the two numbers you remembered (top,bottom) and TEST is your filename.

  5. Again, see that the file is there with  :!dir  but DO NOT remove it.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		   Lesson 5.4: RETRIEVING AND MERGING FILES
       ** To insert the contents of a file, type   :r FILENAME **

  1. Type   :!dir   to make sure your TEST filename is present from before.

  2. Place the cursor at the top of this page.

NOTE:  After executing Step 3 you will see Lesson 5.3.	Then move DOWN to
       this lesson again.

  3. Now retrieve your TEST file using the command   :r TEST   where TEST is
     the name of the file.

NOTE:  The file you retrieve is placed starting where the cursor is located.

  4. To verify that a file was retrieved, cursor back and notice that there
     are now two copies of Lesson 5.3, the original and the file version.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			    Lesson 6.4: SET OPTION
	  ** Set an option so a search or substitute ignores case **

  1. Search for 'ignore' by entering:
     /ignore
     Repeat several times by hitting the n key
  2. Set the 'ic' (Ignore case) option by typing:
     :set ic
  3. Now search for 'ignore' again by entering: n
     Repeat search several more times by hitting the n key
  4. Set the 'hlsearch' and 'incsearch' options:
     :set hls is
  5. Now enter the search command again, and see what happens:
     /ignore

> To quickly you can select characters along a column, in Vim, press CTRL+v - now you can select columns. The following command is 8j, letting Vim know that I want to go eight lines down. Then, I press s to substitute a character, and I type in the character t, which I want to put there. Finally, I press Esc twice, and the whole column is changed.
