Kubernetes Services enable communication between various components within and outside of the application. Kubernetes Services helps us connect applications together with other applications or users. For example, our application has groups of PODs running various sections, such as a group for serving front-end load to users, another group running back-end processes, and a third group connecting to an external data source. It is Services that enable connectivity between these groups of PODs. Services enable the front-end application to be made available to users, it helps communication between back-end and front-end PODs, and helps in establishing connectivity to an external data source. Thus services enable loose coupling between microservices in our application.

# Service types
- Nodeport
- ClusterIP
- LoadBalancer
## NodePort

## ClusterIP

The PODs all have an IP address assigned to them as we can see on the screen. But these Ips as we know are not static, these PODs can go down anytime and new PODs are created all the time – and so you CANNOT rely on these IP addresses for internal communication within the application. Also what if the first front-end POD at 10.244.0.3 need to connect to a backend service? Which of the 3 would it go to and who makes that decision?

A kubernetes service can help us group these PODs together and provide a single interface to access the PODs in a group. For example a service created for the backend PODs will help group all the backend PODs together and provide a single interface for other PODs to access this service.The requests are forwarded to one of the PODs under the service randomly. Similarly, create additional services for Redis and allow the backend PODs to access the redis system through this service. This enables us to easily and effectively deploy a microservices based application on kubernetes cluster. Each layer can now scale or move as required without impacting communication between the various services. Each service gets an IP and name assigned to it inside the cluster and that is the name that should be used by other PODs to access the service. This type of service is known as ClusterIP.

## LoadBalancer
![[Pasted image 20230616113452.png]]

let them choose one of their own. What end users really want is a single URL to access the application. For this, you will be required to setup a separate Load Balancer VM in your environment. In this case I deploy a new VM for load balancer purposes and configure it to forward requests that come to it to any of the
Ips of the Kubernetes nodes. I will then configure my organizations DNS to point to this load balancer when a user hosts http://myapp.com. Now setting up that load balancer by myself is a tedious task, and I might have to do that in my local or on- prem environment. However, if I happen to be on a supported CloudPlatform, like Google Cloud Platform, I could leverage the native load balancing functionalities of the cloud platform to set this up. Again you don’t have to set that up manually, Kubernetes sets it up for you. Kubernetes has built-in integration with supported cloud platforms.
