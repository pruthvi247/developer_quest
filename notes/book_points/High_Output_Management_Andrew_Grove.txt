>Tobias describes High Output Management as the perfect book for non-entrepreneurs. A book that simplifies the world of business into basic principles.

>In the book, the author compares being a manager to being a waiter. As a waiter, you constantly have to prioritize tasks. Do you bring the menu to the couple that just walked in, or do you serve the boiled egg that’s been waiting in the kitchen for three minutes already?

>He continues with the metaphor, offering five key performance indicators:

>Sales forecasts answer the question: how many customers are you expecting to serve today? This has direct implications on how many staff and inventory do you need to keep the customers satisfied.

>Inventory levels seem like an obvious parameter to watch but is so often forgotten by inexperienced managers. CEOs who fail to evaluate their inventory levels fail to fulfil orders, and that is about the worst customer experience there is.

>Condition of the equipment refers to your production instruments. As a waiter, have you checked whether the toaster is working today? The customers won’t care if “it’s not your fault.” They’ll simply choose another place next time.

>Workforce indicators are needed to keep track of your staff. Just like it’s your responsibility as a manager to make sure the toaster is working, you need to check if any of your kitchen staff called in sick today. In that case, you’ll need an urgent replacement.

>Quality indicators are often forgotten by managers. Did the customers like the breakfast? Will they come back again? Companies that fail to learn go bankrupt, and Tobias learned this lesson without having to fail himself.

>All of these things may seem unimportant before you make your first sale. Once you get a few orders, you’ll run into management problems really quickly.

>High Output Management explains core business concepts in rigid logical terms, which is perfect for engineers who want to take their career a decisive step further.

>After reading the book, Tobias remembers realizing that

>“…basically, at the end of the day, creating a business is an engineering exercise. That made the whole thing about becoming a CEO significantly less scary to me because I understand engineering.”

It’s Not About How Many Books You Read — It’s About What Books You Read
>In Tobias’s case, he was highly adept in programming but lacking psychology and business skills. Instead of deepening his coding knowledge, he chose to read about areas of life that he knew nothing about.

The result is Shopify, and it needs no introduction.
