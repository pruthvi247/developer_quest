Data Structure:

A Data Structure is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively


Abstract Data Type(ADT):

An abstract data type is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to.The interface does not give any speific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language

ADT			Implementation
---			--------------
List 			Dynamic Array,Linked List
Queue 			Linked List based Queue,Array based Queue,Stacked based Queue
Map 			Tree Map, Hash Map,Hash Table
Vehicle 		Cart,Bicycle,Smart Car

Big O Notation:

> Big O notation gives an upper bound of the complexity in the worst case

complexities ordered in form smallest to largest

constant time : O(1)
Logarithemic time : O(log(n))
Linear time : O(n)
Linearithmic time : O(nlog(n))a
Quadatic time : O(n*2)
Cubic time : O(n*3)
Exponential time : O(b*n), b>1
Factorial time : O(n!)

Big O examples:
-------------
> finding all subsets of set - O(2*n)
> finding all permutations of a string -O(n!)
> Sorting using merge sort - O(nlog(n))
> iterating over all the cells in a matrix of size n by m - O(nm)

Static and Dynamic Arrays:

Complexity:

		Static		Dynamic Array

Access		O(1)		O(1)
Search		O(n)		O(n)
Insertion	Not Applicable  O(n)
Appending	NA 		O(1)
Deletion	NA 		O(n)
